# Kalman filter

In this class, you will implement a basic [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) along with a mouse-tracking example similar to what you've seen on [lecture 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSz1_lcR62_W_70RWyGCPF-Fo27qdCqLja3BiG2DSFc6O-GOUDKi9tNskNLJgnpWl0bnpCcE5ucM9I4/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.g1ec40388a3a_0_17).

Kalman filter is used to approximate true state of the world given noisy observations (e.g. sensor noise). 

Some notation: at timestep $k$:
- \$$z_k$$ denotes the observation
- \$$t_k$$ denotes the true state of the world
- \$$x_k$$ denotes the estimate of the state of the world
- \$$P_k$$ denotes the  covariance of the estimate of the state of the world
- \$$A_k$$ is a matrix that denotes the state transition model (note that since we are dealing with discrete model, this matrix might depent on time elapsed from previous timestep)
- $v_k$ and $w_k$ denote random (gaussian and independent) noise

Kalman filter assumes that world state transitions in a following manner:

$$ t_{k} = A_k t_{k-1} + v_k  $$


Kalman filter has 3 matrix parameters:

- measurement matrix $H$ which denotes how states are mapped to the observation. To be precise 
  $$ z_k = H t_k + w_k $$
- process covariance matrix $Q$ which is the covariance of the random noise $v_k$ ($v_k$ comes from distribution $N(0, Q)$)
- measurement covariance matrix $R$ which is the covariance of the random noise $w_k$ ($w_k$ comes from distribution $N(0, R)$) 

Kalman filter has two phases:

- **predict** when it predicts the new state and updates covariance matrix
  $$ x'_k = A_k x_{k-1} $$
  $$ P'_k = A_k P_k A_k^T + Q $$

- **update** when it updates the predictions based on observations
  $$ y = z_k - Hx'_k $$
  $$ S = HP'_kH^T + R$$
  $$ K = P'_kH^TS^{-1} $$
  $$ x_k = x'_k + Ky$$
  $$ P_k = (I - KH)P'_k  $$

If we don't have an observation from current timestep, then $x_k = x'_k$ and $P_k = P'_k$.

## Example calculation

Let's say that we want to predict only one variable - position on the x-axis.
Our state will be of the form [position, velocity]. 
Since we can only observe position, out measurement matrix is
```
H = [1, 0]
``` 
Our model assumes that the velocity is constant.
We assume that the process covariance matrix of the model is
```
Q = [[1, 0]
     [0, 1]]
```
And that measurement covariance matrix is
```
R = [10000]
```
Out current state and it's covariance looks like that:
```
x = [231.97740566  56.30126413]
P = [[3288.01907438  1115.25715518]
     [1115.25715518  693.39189069]]
```

Next, we make a prediction. If the time elapsed from last step is $0.002541$, then the A matrix looks as follows:
```
A = [[1.       0.002541]
     [0.       1.      ]]
```
Which gives us
```
x' = A @ x = [232.12046717  56.30126413]

P' = A @ P'@ A.T + Q = [[3294.69128825  1117.01906397]
                        [1117.01906397  694.39189069]]

```
At this step, we measured $z = 313$.
We correct the state to include the observation

```
y = z - H @ x' = [80.87953283]

S = H @ P @ H.T + R = [[13294.69128825]]

K = P' @ H.T @ inv(S) = [[0.24782007]
                         [0.08401993]]

x = x' + K @ y = [252.16403843  63.09675701]

P = (I - K @ H) @ P' = [[2478.20067185  840.19932449]
                        [840.19932449  600.54002439]]


```

## Task 1 - filter implementation

You are given kalman.py file with partialy implemented Kalman filter.
Implement the measurement matrix
```python
        # Measurement Matrix
        ## TODO ##
        # Set the measurement matrix H
        self.H = ...
```
Then implement predicting the next state
```python
    def predict(self, dt):
        ### TODO ###
        # State Transition Matrix
        A = ...
        x = ...
        P = ...
        ###
```
$A$ should be a state transition matrix with the assumption that velocity is constant.

Finally, implement update of the state and covarience matrix after measurement.
```python
    def update(self, measurement):
        # Update the state with the new measurement
        ### TODO ###
        ...
        x = ...
        P = ...
        pass
        ### ###
```

## Task 2 - mouse tracking

In a file kalman.py there is a partly implemented mouse tracker. 

Complete implementation of `mouse_callback` so that it makes prediction and calls update method of kalman filter. 
```python
    def mouse_callback(self, event, x, y, flags, param):
        # Check if the event is a left button click
        if event == cv2.EVENT_LBUTTONDOWN:
            current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
            print(f"Time: {current_time}, Position: ({x}, {y})")
            new_time = datetime.datetime.now()
            ### TODO ###
            # Predict the next state

            ###
            self.cur_time = new_time

            cv2.circle(self.img, (x, y), 2, (0, 0, 255), -1)  # Red color, filled circle

            ### TODO ###
            # Update the state with the new measurement

            ###
            print(f"Updated State: {kf.x}")
```

Then, complete the `run` method so that it predicts the state and draws a circle where the mouse click should be

```python
  def run(self):
        # Main loop to display the window
        while True:
            # Display an empty image (or any image you want to display)

            new_time = datetime.datetime.now()

            ### TODO ###
            # Predict the next state

            self.cur_time = new_time

            ### TODO ###
            # Use the predicted state to draw a circle on the image
            x = ...
            y = ...
            cv2.circle(
                self.img, (int(x), int(y)), 2, (255, 0, 0), -1
            )  # Red color, filled circle
            cv2.imshow(self.window_name, self.img)
```

End result should look something like this:
